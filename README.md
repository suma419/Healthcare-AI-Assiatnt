Current Knowledge Graph from conversations: Knowledge Graph
Key Features
Conversational Health Assistance: The chatbot can respond to user queries about health and appointments.
Change Requests Alerting: Users can raise requests for appointment or Treatment changes to their doctor.
Conversation History: Users can view their past interactions, filtered by date, in a side panel, with an added search functionality.
