## Project Overview
HealthMate is designed to assist users with the following:
- Answering health-related queries.
- Escalate change requests to Doctor.
- Maintaining conversation histories for easy reference.
- Using an LLM-agnostic design to swap different language models (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT-4 or Mistral models) with ease.
- Assistant logic graph:

## Key Features
- **Conversational Health Assistance:** The chatbot can respond to user queries about health and appointments.
- **Change Requests Alerting:** Users can raise requests for appointment or Treatment changes to their doctor.
- **Conversation History:** Users can view their past interactions, filtered by date, in a side panel, with an added search functionality.
- **LLM-Agnostic Design:** The project supports multiple LLMs through a unified interface. Currently only OpenAI models are fully supported. Mistral's and Google's are in development.
- **RAG** Integrated Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG), allowing chatbot to provide responses from a knowledge base.
- **Knowledge Graph Integration:** Connects to a Neo4j database for context-aware responses.

## Setting Up the Project Locally
Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.10+**: Ensure you have Python installed.
- **Django 5.x**: Install the Django framework.
- **Neo4j**: You need a running instance of Neo4j or can use their cloud database AuraDB.
- **PostgreSQL**: For database management.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nisargptl/healthmate.git
cd healthmate/healthmate
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

### Step 3: Install Required Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```bash
# .env file
API_KEY=<your_llm_api_key>
LLM_MODEL=openai # (mistralai or googleai under development.) 
MODEL_NAME=<model_name> # (gpt-4)
PINECONE_API_KEY=<your_pinecone_api_key>
NEO4J_URI=<your_neo4j_uri>
NEO4J_USER=<your_neo4j_username>
NEO4J_PASSWORD=<your_neo4j_password>
DB_NAME=healthmate_db
DB_USER=<db_user>
DB_PASSWORD=<your_db_password>
```

### Step 5: Set Up the Database
Create Database:
```bash
psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE heatlthmate_db;
CREATE USER yourusername WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE healthmate_db TO yourusername;
ALTER USER yourusername WITH SUPERUSER;
\q
```

Apply the database migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 6: Start the Django Development Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Step 7: Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to access the HealthMate chatbot.

## Running the Application
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. **Start the Django Server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

3. **Access the Web Application:**
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
   

## How to Use
1. **Ask Health-Related Queries:**
   Enter your health-related queries in the chatbox to receive AI-generated responses.

2. **Schedule or Reschedule Appointments:**

- The `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_API_KEY`, and other environment variables are set correctly in the `.env` file.
- Neo4j and PostgreSQL databases are set up and accessible.
- The user has basic knowledge of Django and Python.

## Additional Notes
- The project uses `langchain` and `langgraph` libraries to implement the chatbot flow and support for LLM integration.
- The frontend is built with vanilla JavaScript and custom CSS for responsive UI.
